# 5th time's the charm: My  journey with Hashnode's 2Articles1Week challenge

### I have a confessionâ€¦

You know how they warn people who want tattoos about how they can get addicting? Well, thatâ€™s how I feel about Hashnodeâ€™s 2Articles1Week challenge. After winning the bronze medal, me being on a huge writing high decided to do this change again. So grab a snack (or water) and letâ€™s reminisce on my experience with this challenge.

### Challenges

I really enjoyed writing my pull request tutorial and DevOps productivity tips post, so naturally, I thought writing another two articles would be a breeze. Boy, was I wrong! Out of the two, the post on debugging was an absolute nightmare. Every time I came up with a witty and engaging title, I'd realize that it wasn't SEO-friendly or Hashnode's Debug Writeathon-friendly. It was like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. After days of struggling, I finally resorted to using a headline analyzer for tips. And you know what? I came up with a title that would make even Google proud. As for writing the content of the post, well, let's just say I was cringing and laughing while writing about my debugging moments. But hey, at least I found humor in my misery. Ok, enough with the bemoaning about my debugging nightmares, let's lighten the mood a little bit. Play the next clip!

### Accomplishments

If I had to pick an accomplishment for this challenge, it would be my growth as a writer. feel like I've grown as a writer. Before this challenge, I found that my humor was dry and slightly bland like uncooked ramen. But now, I can confidently say that my writing is more flavorful than a 5-star restaurant's menu. I mean, did you see the way I seamlessly integrated that cooking reference just now? Pure gold. I mean sure, I did not win any other badge yet, but getting better at writing is the ultimate prize. I guess you can say that this experience taught me the importance of finding pockets of joy in the face of struggles. Ok, here I go being sappy again. Let's move on before I start crying! ðŸ¥¹

### Conclusion

Overall, I had a blast with this challenge. I mean, who doesn't love a good dose of coding-induced headaches and caffeine-fueled all-nighters? But in all seriousness, this challenge taught me a lot about writing, coding, and finding humor in the midst of struggles. And who knows, maybe next time I'll snag that elusive gold badge. Or maybe I'll just stick to my trusty bronze badge and use it as a makeshift mirror to admire my writing skills. Either way, if you're in need of a coding buddy or just want to see me win (or lose) at the next challenge, be sure to follow me on Hashnode and connect with me on Linkfree. Until next time, happy coding and keep on writing! ðŸ˜Š
