***Disclaimer: I'm not a spokesperson for OpenAI or OpenChat. This post is about my experiences with ChatGPT, nothing more, nothing less.***

Now let's get started with our regularly scheduled program!

## Legends

What does Jarvis from *Ironman*, Alexa, and Siri have in common with ChatGPT? They are legends (or in ChatGPT’s case, legend-in-the-making) that have one name. Now, what is ChatGPT you ask? It’s an AI tool that can help you brainstorm paragraph ideas for that 15-page final essay you’ve been dreading to write, suggest lines that prevent you from sounding like a blubbering fool while proposing to your partner or help you organize a ToDo list so you won’t forget to buy laundry detergent again. Basically, ChatGPT helps you write content quickly. Still curious? Well, join me as I explore the good and the limitations of this AI wordsmith.

## The Good

As the new kid in the blogging world, ChatGPT has been a lifesaver when it comes to brainstorming ideas and organizing my outlines.

*It's so magical! 🥹*

When it comes to writing, I tend to be very picky about what I create, and using ChatGPT has helped me tailor content to suit my audience and voice. I would often ask questions like “Does this sound like me”? and if I say no, I then ask myself “How can I say this in my own words?”.

ChatGPT has been pretty much like the writing genie that I’ve always wanted. But unlike the one in *Aladdin*, let’s just say my wishes haven’t always been granted.

## Flaws

It’s been awesome using ChatGPT but like most things in life, it has its flaws. For instance, It would also show error signs whenever I modify my prompts, which causes me to have to either refresh the page or start a whole new thread. This is very annoying, especially when I finally find the perfect way to explain a point in my post. 🤦🏾‍♀️

I thought we were friends! 😭

Even though it’s not always perfect, ChatGPT is still a great writing sidekick, so I don’t want to whine and complain too much. 😉
