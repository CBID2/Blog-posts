## Time to be honest

I have a confession to make. I struggle with describing the code snippets I use in my technical articles. I know, I know, it‚Äôs shocking, but all hope isn‚Äôt lost. For the past few months, I have been using this awesome tool to help me overcome this struggle. This, my friend, is called Pieces. I first learned about it from my friend, @sophyia, a former DevRel at the company. She asked me to join their guest writing program after reading my articles on freeCodeCamp's website. I‚Äôm a believer in trying a product before writing about it. So, I decided to download [the desktop app](https://docs.pieces.app/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing) and install the [Chrome extension](https://docs.pieces.app/extensions-plugins/web-extension) to see what it‚Äôs about. After a few days of using it, I was hooked. Now before I start sharing more tech confessions, let me tell you what exactly Pieces is.

## Is Pieces candy?

As delicious Reese‚Äôs Pieces is, this type of Pieces is not something you can eat. It is actually an free AI tool that assists when you are coding.Think of it as a technical Tinkerbell from Peter Pan[1](about:blank#fn1). If you want to learn more about what Pieces can do, check out their short intro video here ‚¨áÔ∏è

Now that you two have met, let me show you how I use Pieces in my workflow.

## Pieces: the code catcher

In the past, I‚Äôd save code snippets that I wanted to use in my blog posts with the Chrome browser's bookmark feature. Unfortunately, I‚Äôd either scramble through so many tabs or the **Bookmarks** tab to find them. This left me with a headache. Once I started using Pieces‚Äô web extension, I had a much easier time finding my saved code snippets. Here‚Äôs how:

**Step one: Highlight a line of code**

![Screenshot of highlighted code](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/831l5hsppsz3a413ct5t.png align="left")

**Step two: Right-click and pick the option, *Save to Pieces***.

![Screenshot of Save to Pieces option being highlighted](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lk3b5w0v01iq4tri5dne.png align="left")

**Step three:** Go to **Saved Snippets** area of the Desktop app

![Screenshot of highlighted code appearing in the Saved Materials area of the Desktop app](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5bym5mov1an4dlsdwk5p.png align="left")

And viola, a saved code snippet! It's like a technical version of a Pokeball for catching Pokemon!üòä Pretty cool right? üòâ

Now before I start rambling about this feature, there's another one I want to show you! üòÄ

## Pieces: the code‚Äôs pok√©dex

In the Desktop app, there‚Äôs a feature called [Copilot chat](https://docs.pieces.app/features/pieces-copilot). It‚Äôs like the Pok√©dex but for coding! üòÄ

![Pieces: Your Ultimate Coding AI Best Friend](https://onepubli-sh.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/uploads/e08b150f-e656-44cc-94a3-8cf73fa23036.gif align="left")

I tend to use it if I‚Äôm struggling with fixing a line of code I‚Äôm creating for my open source contributions or projects. For example, I was working on the JavaScript file for [my 404 page project](https://github.com/CBID2/404-page).

I wanted to reference a line of code from that file in the project's README but I was struggling to describe it. After doing some mental ping pong, I typed my code in the copilot chat and asked for some for help:

![Pieces: Your Ultimate Coding AI Best Friend](https://onepubli-sh.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/uploads/f8f3776f-67c9-43a6-bd2a-3311b9b06db6.png align="left")

In the above screenshot, the copilot explains that my code snippet selects the search input field and search button elements from the webpage. It also mentions that after the user clicks on the search button, the event listener sends the user to their desired section of Codedex's website. Even though I didn‚Äôt win the challenge, I did win in knowledge! üòÄ

## Pieces: the time traveler

In the Pieces Copilot, there is a new feature called [Live Context](https://docs.pieces.app/product-highlights-and-benefits/live-context). It looks back at the content you recently viewed. It's kind of like a time machine minus the risks of changing people‚Äôs futures or causing them to not exist. Now before I start rambling on about the cons of time traveling, let‚Äôs see how it works[2](about:blank#fn2):

Click on the **New Chat** button.

![Step 1 of using Live Context](https://onepubli-sh.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/uploads/93b3a402-58a3-456e-93c0-a040548368ba.gif align="left")

Turn on the **Live Context** toggle.[3](about:blank#fn3)

![Step 2 of using Live Context](https://onepubli-sh.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/uploads/ccf1c973-468c-4292-b075-9a06510becb4.gif align="left")

Then, type your question or idea in the chat or use the **Suggested Prompts**.

![Step 3 of using Live Context](https://onepubli-sh.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/uploads/47a17ae7-e567-40be-a21f-22a027d32536.png align="left")

As shown in the screenshot above, I‚Äôve made it to the writing stage of my technical article. In the past, I would rely on my brain to remember what I‚Äôve written, which gets annoying. Once I started using the Live Context feature, it was easier for me to track my progress. This feature is also helpful if you are looking through files in a large codebase. For example, I was reviewing an issue for an open source project, but I was not sure which files needed the changes. So I went to the Copilot chat, typed ‚ÄúWhere can I make add the canonical links?‚Äù, and got this response:

![Screenshot of my conversation with the copilot chat](https://onepubli-sh.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/uploads/1363e72b-0ccc-4960-8787-94351b008f11.png align="left")

This, I got advice on how to structure the canonical link and where to place them. All in all, the new Live Context feature is awesome.

## Things to improve and add in the future

As much as I found Pieces enjoyable to use, there are some aspects of the tool that can use some improvement. Having to turn on the Live Context switch each time I start a chat on the Desktop app can get a bit tedious. So it would be beneficial to have the option to toggle the button on or off once. Also, the Co-pilot chat feature does not have a text-to-speech option. This can make it difficult for users with low motor skills to read the AI's long responses. Furthermore, adding this option would make reading these responses more bearable.

In the future, it would be awesome if there is a mobile version of the Desktop app. I sometimes work on my blog posts on my tablet, so having this would make it easier for me to finish them, especially if I‚Äôm away from my laptop.

## Now it‚Äôs your turn

There you have it folks, my product review of Pieces! Whether you are a technical writer or a developer, it is a great tool that improves your workflow. Also, the people at the company receptive to feedback and works fast to address your concerns. Overall, I recommend adding Pieces to your tech stack. Now enough of me talking, click on the links below to download the tool, join the community, [connect with me on Linktree](https://linktr.ee/ChrissyCodes), and start working! üôÇ
