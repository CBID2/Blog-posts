For the past few months, I have been immersing myself in the magical world of coding(well, mostly HTML & CSS. I will make you mine, JavaScript! Mark my words!). Just when I thought my thirst for knowledge was quenched by listening to Matt Delac compare CSS to the paint on houses in SheCodes or being a huge Scrimba fan, I was introduced to a whole new fountain‚Ä¶

OPEN SOURCE!!

*Exactly Millie. Mind blown!*

I was first introduced to open source through a colleague on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)‚Äôs Discord community, and it was love at first Pull Request(it was not easy to do, but that‚Äôs a blog post for another time).

## **What are Open Source Projects?**

Well, think of OSPs as that Google Slides or Microsoft PowerPoint presentation you had to do for school, but for software engineers, backend engineers, frontend developers, and other folks from different industries.

Still unsure? Well, here are my top 5 reasons why you should participate in Open Source Projects.

# **Reason #1: Collaboration**

You get to meet people from different backgrounds, and more often than not, they are eager to share their approaches to contributing to projects or give you feedback on your work, especially if you are new to open source projects.

Collaborating with others on these projects will help you learn how to work with others and give feedback. When I made my first contribution to [EddieHub‚Äôs Linkfree project](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree), it felt good seeing my Pull Request merge into the project. As an Open Source beginner who does not work in the tech industry, seeing my contributions to the project‚Äôs repository made me feel like my idea mattered.

# **Reason #2: Show off your expertise.**

Contrary to popular belief, you don‚Äôt have to be a coder to participate in Open Source projects. Whether it‚Äôs drawing, graphic design, or music production, there are so many ways you can contribute.

When I first saw [Acessibleforall‚Äôs project](https://github.com/AccessibleForAll), I noticed that the YouTube section in their Resources repository was missing video links, so I added some to that area and wrote brief descriptions about them. I also would read through the repo‚Äôs documentation to see if there are grammatical errors or descriptions that could use more detail.

# **Reason #3: Learn new skills**

Of course, the major benefit of participating in Open Source Projects is learning new skills. It can range from learning HTML and CSS to experimenting with React.

Through my experience contributing to the documentation in EddieHub and AccessibleforAll‚Äôs repositories, I‚Äôve learned how to:

* Effectively format JSON and README files via Markdown.
    
* Make a Pull Request
    
* Review other people‚Äôs Pull Requests.
    
* Clone repositories via Git

*The possibilities are endless!*

# **Reason #4: Communication**

When it comes to interacting with others, Oprah Winfrey said it best, ‚ÄúGreat communication leads to connection‚Äù.

Whether you are going to be a technical writer, software engineer, frontend, or backend developer, more often than not, you‚Äôre going to be working on a team, so having communication skills is imperative. Whenever I review the documentation of an open source project or someone else‚Äôs contribution, I‚Äôd always check my Pull Requests and comments for grammar errors.

# **Conclusion**

I know. I know. Participating in Open Source projects can be scary, but the people you meet and the skills you learn from contributing will all be worth it.
