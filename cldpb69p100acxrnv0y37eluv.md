# Bounce Back: 5 Tips for Staying Motivated After a Job Loss

## Let’s Go!

What do Jason Todd from *The Outlaws*, Ursula from *The Little Mermaid*, and Loki from *Thor* have in common? They all managed to succeed in their careers after being laid off by their employers (or in the case of Loki and Jason, family business, but you get the gist). With the right mindset and approach, you can stay motivated and find success, even in the face of a job search. I have five tips that have been helpful in my own journey, so buckle up, grab a cup of coffee, and a notebook, and let's dive into these tips!

## Tip 1: Reframe Your Mindset

Okay, I know getting that layoff email is rough, but before you start Doordashing food from McDonald’s (or whatever junk food you prefer) or cry your heart out while drinking your special drink and listening to your angst playlist on Spotify, what if I told you that your professional break up was a good thing? I mean, this could be a chance for a new start. Here are some things that can help you reframe your mindset:

* **Take a break and recharge:** Go watch that TV series or movie that your friends have been begging you to watch, or do that cake or cookie recipe you’ve been waiting forever to try.
    
* **Find a new path:** Loved writing detailed explanations on your former employer’s README files? Maybe your next path could be a technical writer. Enjoyed seeing the milestones that you and/or your former projects reached? Consider becoming a Project Manager.
    
* **Focus on skills & experiences gained at work:** Think about some accomplishments you’ve made in your previous position and add them to your resume. You’ll know, your next job offer might come soon or later, so it's good to be prepared.
    
* **Enjoy your freedom and flexibility:** Now, you can sleep in more if you'd want or turn the video game idea that's been swirling nonstop in your mind into an actual side hustle.
    
* **Say no:** Contrary to popular belief, you don’t have to accept every job offer. Sometimes, a job opportunity or company doesn't align with your own goals and values, so don't let things like the salary or perks like vacation discounts waver your decision. Always choose yourself.
    

And with that positive mindset in place, let's rev up our engines and move on to Tip #2!

## Tip 2: Create a Daily Routine

I know, it's tempting to spend all day scrolling through job listings and submitting applications, but unfortunately for us, we’re humans with limits, so we need to take breaks. Creating a routine for yourself can help with that. Here are some strategies that helped me develop a routine:

* Setting aside time for job search activities: I recommend using the Pomodoro technique. It’s helpful with breaking down tasks and making sure that you take breaks as you check them off your to-do list
    
* Include exercising in your routine: Set aside time to do things like running, walking, or whatever physical activity you like doing. They help you stay focused when writing cover letters and resumes. It’s like coffee or Red Bull minus the caffeine.
    
* Staying organized and tracking your progress: Use a spreadsheet or checklist to keep track of the number of jobs you applied for. It’ll keep you from going nuts trying to remember if you sent that follow-up email.
    

Remember, creating a routine isn't about becoming a robot, it's about being productive and taking care of yourself, so you're ready to tackle your job search like a boss. Now let's move on to tip number three.

## Tip 3: Surround Yourself with Support

Contrary to popular belief, asking for help is not weak and neither is tapping into your support system during a job search. Trust me, you're going to need all the help you can get. Here is a list of groups I recommend you join:

* Baddies in Tech
    
* WomenWhoCode
    
* SheSharp
    
* FrontEnd Mentor
    

Remember, sharing your journey and hearing others' stories can be just as freeing as a good episode of House of Dragons (or whichever show you binge-watch). Now, let's move on to the fourth tip.

## Tip 4: Celebrate Your Wins

It's time to put down the job search burnout and raise a glass to your accomplishments. Job searching is a stressful journey, so celebrate any win no matter how small it may seem! Here are some wins to think about:

* Making it to the final stage of an interview
    
* Negotiating your salary with confidence
    
* Finish revising your cover letter and resume within a few hours instead of a day.
    

Go ahead, crack open that bottle of sparkling juice(or whatever drink you like), and celebrate every win, big or small. Trust me, it'll make the journey to landing that dream job a whole lot more fun. Now, let's move on to our final tip!

## Tip 5: Keep Learning and Improving

I know, you’re burnt out from the cover letter and resume writing marathon, but don't give up yet! Adding a new skill to your arsenal could be the game-changer you need in this job search. With technology always advancing, it's important to keep up and stand out from the crowd. Here are some sites I recommend for upskilling:

* Wilco
    
* EddieHub(I know it's an open source community but it's a great platform for tinkering with programming languages you wanted to tinker with)
    
* Wesbos
    

Don’t be afraid to add some new skills to your toolkit. You never know, it might just be the factor that lands you your dream job.
