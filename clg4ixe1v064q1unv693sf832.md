# Save Your Head and Your Data: 3 Do's and Don'ts for Backing Up Your Devices

## A Little Story

Picture this, you just got the latest iOS and Android device. Excitement fills you as you open the package, walk toward your room, and think about the many things you will do with your new device. You finally turn on your now old device. So far, things are going smoothly as you’ve logged into your cloud storage account, but when you clicked on the Transfer button, you get this message:

![iOS data transfer fail message ](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1680745723876/d351ded7-2823-47c1-bcde-da135a699f94.png align="center")

This is where backing up comes in. This is a process where you save things like your parents and partner’s phone number, selfies and photos of your travels, and apps that you use regularly on a different device or online storage. Think of it as putting sunscreen or tanning lotion before going to the beach. Still worried about being hacked? No worries, here are five do’s and don’ts that will keep you sane, your skin protected, and most importantly, your data.

## The Do’s

1. Do use a USB stick

I know, I know, it's an ancient method, but bear with me – it's like carrying around a little tech time capsule that you can stick in any computer. Plus, it won't break the bank, so it's perfect for those of us who are on a budget.

1. Do schedule regular backups
    
    ![Android device showing automatic backup section](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1680748473605/c7aa341f-7eaf-4c02-aebc-33bb9ba43a8c.jpeg align="center")
    

Doing regular backups protects your information from cyberattacks, lets you access things like that coding project you’ve been working on quickly, and you recover your data quickly if your device ends up not working. It’s like brushing your teeth minus the minty freshness.

***Chrissy Tip:*** **If you can afford and/or use cloud storage like iCloud and your Google Account to back up your data, I highly recommend turning on the automatic backup feature like the one you see in the above image. It’ll make the process go quickly. Not sure how? Check out these posts from** [**Apple**](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204136) **and** [**Google**](https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/9149304?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid)**.**

1. Do encrypt your backups for added security.

Encrypting your data is when your file is translated into a different language that can only be accessed by you via password. This is helpful if you retrieve your iOS or Android device after accidentally leaving at work, a classroom, or a relative’s house. Think of it as you being the only person with the four Infinity stones to turn on the [Infinity Gauntlet](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Infinity_Gauntlet)(non-Marvel fans, this was a weapon that was used to destroy Earth in *Avengers: Infinity War* and *Endgame).*

## The Don'ts

1. Don't rely solely on one method of backup

[Hackers are working everyday to get people’s data](https://www.landontechnologies.com/blog/importance-of-testing-backups/), so it’s best to use more than one approach to backing up your data. I know it’s tempting to stick with one method but think about it, using more than one method to back up your data will decrease the likelihood of your information being lost or hacked.

1. Don't make your storage space too full
    

![Iphone storage warning ](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1680748056786/7ccdc23e-114d-432e-8c92-a9ad19f96be1.jpeg align="center")

As tempting as it is to save every photo you’ve taken or all of the school essays that you’ve written, you can’t keep every file. The lack of storage space on your device leads to a very slow backup process. It's like trying to save an ending relationship. Even though you want it to continue, you have to let it go in order for you and your ex-lover to thrive and grow.

1. Don't forget to test your backups regularly

Testing your backups regularly ensures that your backup methods are working. It also prevents you from losing all of your data if your device suddenly stops working Think of it as exercising, when you do it on a daily basis, your body stays strong and healthy.

## Conclusion

Whether it’s on a phone, tablet, laptop, or computer, taking precautions to backing up your devices’ data will not only your information safe but also keeps your mind at peace.
