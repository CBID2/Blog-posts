# Blast Off! Unveiling the Tale of My Space Button

### Where it all began

I stumbled upon a cool mini-coding project on UIverse's website and decided to tackle it. Even though I couldn't fly to Space, I was able to experience the thrill of success after completing the challenge. Join me in reminiscing my triumphs and struggles while I worked on the project. Grab a snack and let's get started!

### My Process

For the HTML, I surrounded my button in &lt;div&gt; tags to make it easier to add a background image in the body. This allowed me to create a cohesive, space-themed design for the entire page. For the CSS, I initially planned on using the positioning property to center the button, but it was difficult to get right. Instead, I chose to use Flexbox, which made it simpler to control the layout and spacing of my button.

However, the real challenge came when I tried to add a space-themed background image and spacey font. I wanted the button to look like it was part of a spaceship control panel, with an image of space in the background and text that looked like it was created by aliens who were welcoming humans to space. I spent a lot of time experimenting with different CSS & JavaScript properties and techniques, trying to get the effect just right. After hitting many brick walls, I went to SheCodes and asked their coding assistant, [Athena](https://www.shecodes.io/athena), for her wisdom. She pointed out that my CSS properties were not formatted properly (Oh how embarrassing! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) and a CSS selector was missing for my spacey font. She also helped me fix the function I created that was supposed to change the image and text to space after the user clicked on the button. Thanks to her help and guidance, I was finally able to achieve the effect I was looking for.

### What I've Learned from This Challenge

One of the biggest takeaways from this project was learning how to center a div with FlexBox, which I can now add to my list of superpowers (move over, Batman). Another valuable lesson I learned was that it's okay to ask for help when you need it. Athena was a lifesaver and kept me from spiraling down a black hole of endless frustration. And let's be honest, sometimes we all need a little help from our coding friends (or enemies, if we're feeling particularly villainous like Harley Quinn).

### Conclusion

Overall, this challenge was a blast (off). It was exciting to create a space-themed button that would make any astronaut proud. I highly recommend doing this challenge if you're looking for projects to do.
