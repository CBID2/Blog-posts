# Four Times the Fun: A Recap of my Latest 2Articles1Week Attempt

### I'm Back!!!

Well, I've just completed my fourth attempt at the Hashnode 2Articles1Week challenge, and I have to say, it was a wild ride. If you're not familiar with the challenge, the idea is to write and publish two articles in a week, which sounds simple enough, right? Ha. Let's just say that after my first three attempts, I was feeling a little bit like Thor fighting Thanos in the last two movies of *The Avengers* series.

But this time around, I approached the challenge with a different mindset. I decided to embrace the process and see where it took me, rather than stressing out about meeting some arbitrary goal. And you know what? It worked. Now, grab a snack (or whatever food you prefer) and settle in for the ride. Trust me, you'll need it.

### What Iâ€™ve learned

For my first submission to the 2Articles1Week challenge, I decided to write about [my final project for SheCodes Plus](https://hashnode.com/post/cle7y1i3f064eznnv1r2y0yyd), a program that has been a godsend in my coding journey. I started Chrissy Codes to showcase the knowledge I've gained along the way, and writing about my creative process for this project was a great way to reflect on how far I've come. It also helped me recognize my strengths and pinpoint areas that need more improvement. Overall, the experience taught me how to discuss my projects in a clear and concise way, something that is valuable both as a coding enthusiast and a blogger.

For my second submission, I wanted to try something different and write a tutorial article. I decided to do a [step-by-step guide on Pull Requests](https://hashnode.com/draft/63edb60563413c0008ecda16), something that I wish I had when I first started contributing to open source projects. Writing this article was a huge step for me because explaining technical jargon in a way that doesn't make people want to bang their heads against the keyboard is not easy. It was satisfying to know that I was able to provide valuable information to others who might be beginning their open source journey.

### Conclusion

And there you have it, folks, a brief flashback on my fourth attempt at Hashnode's 2Articles1Week challenge. It was definitely a wild ride, but I'm proud to say that I made it out unscarred. If you're thinking about trying the challenge for yourself, I say go for it! Just remember to bring water, food, some humor with a hint of patience, and you'll be fine.

If you want to follow along with my coding journey (or just want to see more pictures of my cat), subscribe to my blog and connect with me on [Linkfree](https://linkfree.eddiehub.io/CBID2). I'm always happy to be a cheerleader for fellow coders. Thanks for reading!
