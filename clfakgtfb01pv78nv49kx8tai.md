You know how they say "You learn as you go"? Well, it's actually true. For March, I decided to publish my series, [Bada$$ Women in Tech](https://twitter.com/CodesChrissy/status/1630713924713586689?s=20). It's where I write posts on Twitter about women who made wonderful contributions to the tech industry every day in honor of International Women's History Month. By shining a spotlight on some of the amazing women I’ve worked with, I’ve not only been able to learn the diverse stories and triumphs of women in tech, but I've learned 3 lessons on writing along the way. Now, grab your keyboard and open a new document on Google Docs(or whatever word-processing system you use) because

## 1\. You can contribute to tech in many ways.

When I started Bada$$ Women in Tech, I initially was going to focus on women who are entrepreneurs, CEOs, and founders. As I found and researched more women to spotlight, I quickly realized that whether they are CEO or community manager at a tech start-up, *any* woman's story of contribution to the industry is important and must be shared. Ok onto the next lesson.

## 2\. Go with your gut

I was brainstorming some names to add to my list of women to highlight, and I came across this person:

![Angelica Ross is a dark-skinned Black woman with a blonde buzzcut with piercing eyes and a soft smile](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1678937031918/ac38ba8d-d84f-423b-9cf7-14d7e4dafd0a.jpeg align="left")

*This is Angelica Ross. She's known for playing Candy on Pose and runs a non-profit tech organization called* [*TransTech Social Enterprise*](https://transtechsocial.org/)

At first, I was really excited about the idea of including her in my series but then I remembered that some parts of Twitter have bigoted views about transwomen, so I experienced a little bit of mental ping-pong game. On one hand, I wanted to share her story since my goal for this series was to celebrate women from diverse backgrounds in tech, but on the other hand, I did not want Ross and any other transwoman to be subjected to potential bullying and harassment. So I posted my concern on one of the Discord channels in [Baddies in Tech](https://www.baddiesintech.com/) (one of the greatest communities I've ever been in) and asked for some advice. A few minutes later, one person mentioned that I was doing a good thing by adding Ross to my lineup and just simply block any Twitter trolls(To social media newbies, trolls are individuals who often post negative comments under a person's post) from my thread. They also suggested that I post a link to my tweet so they can retweet it and defend my post against negative comments. So, I took that person's advice and made that post. Ok, I'm getting sappy, so let's get back to the lessons before I start crying.

## 3\. Be open to suggestions

As cliche as it sounds, two hands are actually better than one. Since I started this series, I have received a lot of support and some suggestions from other women on ladies to spotlight in my series. This warmed my heart because it shows that my series' goal is being achieved: empowering women in the tech community. Ok, let's move on before I get emotional!

## Takeaways

Overall, I am very proud of starting this series, and I look forward to seeing how many women I can empower as it continues to grow. Speaking for growth, if you have any suggestions on what you would like to be spotlighted, post them in the comments section below.
