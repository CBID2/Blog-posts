## I Have a Question for You

What does Esmeralda from Disney‚Äôs [*The Hunchback of Notre*](https://disneys-the-hunchback-of-notre-dame-wiki.fandom.com/wiki/Esmeralda) and Antiope from DC's [*Wonder Woman*](https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Antiope_(Prime_Earth))(the comic book version) have in common? They are two awesome women who started communities after noticing that the people in their hometowns are overlooked and ignored. Sometimes, you have to create a solution to see change. I know it‚Äôs intimidating at first but it‚Äôs worth it in the end. If you‚Äôre interested in starting an online community, you‚Äôve come to the right place. Grab a snack, or your favorite drink, and join me as I share five 5 important lessons I have learned from creating an online community.

## Lesson 1: Define your community‚Äôs purpose

Like most things in life, you have to find your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù. As cliche as this sounds, finding a reason for wanting to create this community helps you think of ways to organize it, how promote it, and ultimately solve the problem you want to speak out. For me, I decided to create ‚ÄúOpen Source Queens‚Äù after receiving positive feedback on a viral discussion post where I questioned why women and non-binary-founded open source projects are not being promoted as much as ones founded by men. I wanted to create a place where womxn can share content about their experiences as open source contributors, maintainers, and project founders. Now hold on, defining your community‚Äôs purpose is only one part of creating an online community. The next step requires a bit more focus, so drink some water, roll up your sleeves, and

## Lesson 2: Finding the right platform

While it‚Äôs true that the people are what makes a community successful, having the right website that suits your community‚Äôs purpose is just as important. Think of it as buying a laptop that would help with things like taking online classes, doing your coding projects, or watching the latest episode of Swarm on Amazon Prime. When picking an online platform, here are some factors that you should consider:

* Easy-to-use tools
    
* Familiarity among the people
    
* Cross-browser and device compatibility
    
* Easy enrollment
    

When I was picking platforms to start ‚ÄúOpen Source Queens‚Äù, I decided to pick [daily.dev](https://daily.dev) because they fit those criteria as well as having guidelines that ensure the safety of users and that the content being posted is high-quality. Oh wait, there‚Äôs more. As they say ‚ÄúRome wasn‚Äôt built in a day‚Äù so there are some things you need to know when starting an online community.

## Lesson 3: Interact with members

A wise man once said, ‚ÄúWith great power comes great responsibility‚Äù.(R.I.P Uncle Ben from [Spiderman](https://spiderman-films.fandom.com/wiki/Uncle_Ben_(Cliff_Robertson))) While sitting on your throne, I mean computer chair, and observing people‚Äôs comments or creating their posts is cool, interacting with other members is so much more fun When I received my first group member, I went to her article, read it, and shared my response to her discussion question. A couple of minutes later, other members started sharing their responses to her question. Seeing the conversation grow was enjoyable and made me feel like my mission for Open Source Queens is being achieved. Ok before I start crying, let‚Äôs move on to how to stay consistent.

## Lesson 4: Stay true to your community‚Äôs mission

I‚Äôm going to be honest. When you create an online community, you tend to make decisions that can impact a member‚Äôs experience, and that‚Äôs not always easy. One time, I was scrolling through [Open Source Queens](https://app.daily.dev/squads/opensourcequeens/ay9Tv4cYCMwzSIGvILfxHhqIuetuDIeO1jJ9o80h6hg) and saw a post that had a link to an article. When I clicked on the link and saw the profile pic, I noticed it showed a picture of a male-presenting individual. At first, I hesitated to comment because I didn't want to make the user feel embarrassed, but then I thought to myself, "You started this space to center womxn's voices. How would it look if you didn't stay true to that mission?‚Äù So, I took a deep breath and gently asked the original poster for their gender to make sure that the community's mission wasn't being compromised. She thanked me for the reminder and clarified that the article was written by her and that the male-presenting person shared it in another community on [daily.dev](http://daily.dev). It felt great to see her receptiveness toward my feedback because it showed that I was creating a wonderful experience. So, here's my advice to you: if you're thinking about starting an online community, be prepared to make tough decisions. But remember, the most important thing is to stay true to your mission and create a space where everyone feels welcome and respected.

## Lesson 5: Share it with the world

As corny as it sounds, closed mouths truly do not get fed. Online communities do not grow by not keeping it to yourself. What has been helping me grow ‚ÄúOpen Source Queens‚Äù is:

* Writing about it on Twitter.
    
* Mentioning it in audio spaces about increasing diversity in the open source community.
    
* Sharing the invitation link in Slack and Discord communities that focused on helping womxn start their careers in tech.
    

All in all, people crave to be in a community with each other, so why not feed them?
