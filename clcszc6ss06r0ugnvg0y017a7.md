# 2in1 Writing Challenge: A Week of Words and Wins

# What A Week

If I had to pick a highlight of the previous week, it would be surviving Hashnode‚Äôs 2in1 writing challenge. It‚Äôs a two-week sprint of blogging chaos where creators are challenged to write and publish two articles in just seven days. I‚Äôm not going to lie, I was very hesitant to do this challenge since I‚Äôm new to blogging, but then I decided to try it. I mean, I talked about punching imposter syndrome in the face(metaphorically speaking. No harm was made during the production of this blog.) in my first post, and writing is my thing. Piece of cake right? üòä Boy was I wrong.

*Storytime!*

## Shutting off that inner critic

A major obstacle that I faced during the 2-in-1 challenge was my inner critic. You know, that little voice inside your head that constantly yammers, *This is terrible, This must be perfect!, You‚Äôre still a newbie! Why are you doing this?*

After having the internal conversation with my inner critic a la Chandler Bing style, I took a deep breath, drank some water, turned on some [Lofi beats](https://youtu.be/rUxyKA_-grg), and started writing. A couple of hours later, I managed to create two articles for my Open Source series!

## Inspiring Others

Even though gaining new followers is awesome, the comments I received from close colleagues and others are what made me feel successful in this challenge. They told me that my blog inspired them to start learning how to code and participate in my open source contributions. I mean, there‚Äôs an indescribable feeling that comes from knowing that your content inspired someone else! üòä Outside of the comments, this challenge helped me realize that I tend to use humor and a combination of formal and informal language, especially when describing open source and tech-related terms. Overall, I‚Äôve grown a lot as a new blogger.

## Conclusion

So there you have it folks: my fun and crazy experience through the 2in1 writing challenge! It was difficult but so worth it in the end. If you‚Äôre a seasoned blogger or a newbie like me, don‚Äôt be afraid to do this challenge. I know it seems that way in the beginning, but trust me, the sense of accomplishment you‚Äôll feel when hitting ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù is awesome!
